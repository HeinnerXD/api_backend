Turn your hairstyle into a work of art with the Bed Head Massive Shine Wave Artist, now with 2X Tourmaline Ceramic Technology to tackle unwanted frizz and add an extra shine boost to your hair.

The Bed Head Wave Artist also features a plate-locking switch for easy storage in less space and a tangle-free swivel cord that makes it easy to style with. HOW TO GET THE LOOK: Starting at the roots, lightly clamp a small section of hair between the barrels and hold for a few seconds. Style one-inch sections of the hair for natural-looking beach waves, or larger sections for uniform, sculpted waves. For a consistent pattern throughout, match the outermost wave and work it down your hair.",

THE BEST HAIR TIE FOR YOUR HAIR: Brunette 8 pack is perfect for any hair color! Kitsch hair coils are gentle on your hair. The smooth plastic, spiralized construction helps to prevent tangling and consequently prevents hair breakage when you remove them.;HELP PREVENT PONYTAIL BUMPS & HAIR HEADACHES: The spiral design of telephone cord hair ties spreads the \"pressure\" of the hair elastic out over a greater surface area of your hair, which helps to minimize the dreaded ponytail bump that hair ties can create on styled hair. Hair headaches from too-tight ponytails are also a thing of the past! Traditional hair ties function by concentrating the tension in a single area of your hair, prevent damage and strand breakage by spreading out the tension;CUTE IN YOUR HAIR, AND ON YOUR WRIST: Kitsch Hair Coils are an everyday essential and come in a variety of beautiful colors. Whether you are looking to match your hair color, or add a fun pop of color to your top knot, Kitsch has the coils for you. Perfect for blondes, brunettes, redheads and any color in between. Kitsch coils also look great on your wrist. The coils stretch to comfortably wear as a bracelet when not in use, so they are ready for ponytail or messy bun duty at any time.;WATERPROOF AND HYGIENIC: Phone cord hair ties are non-absorbent, so they can be worn while swimming or bathing without that \"nasty wet hair tie\" feeling, and they can be removed from wet hair much more easily than a traditional ponytail holder. Also, because they do not absorb fluids, Kitsch hair coils are more hygienic than fabric wrapped rubberbands.;SMALL BUT MIGHTY!: Kitsch hair coils are 1.5 inches in diameter, but don't be deceived by their size! Kitsch coils stretch easily and generously to hold up all of your hair in a ponytail, messy bun, or braid, and comfortably stretch to be worn on your wrist when not in use. If your coil happens to stretch larger than its original size, simply place it in a cup of warm water or use a hot blow dryer to shrink it to its original size.",

By taking advantage of a synergistic formula which works to solve the root problems which are the cause of dandruff, Sage is dermatologist-recommended for its ability to fight the causes and conditions of dermatitis. Made of the most organic and mild ingredients, the shampoo which holds our signature formula is great for all hair types, especially those sensitive to SLS or other detergents of that degree. The Formula/Benefits: Sage: Contains the most effective anti-inflammatory and anti-septic properties to combat dermatitis. Authentic and not part of the cosmetic nation which uses cheaper chemical alternatives, sage is also a natural benefit for those experiencing problems with hair loss. Spikenard: Works to restore pigmentation to the hair and assists in the battle against dermatitis. This exotic and luscious addition also works together with sage to promote hair growth. Rosemary: Rich in verbenone, this asset stimulates cell renewal of the hair follicles. Partnering with tea tree oil which clears out the dead cells, it also stimulates new hair growth and improves circulation. Jojoba and Argan Oils: they provide hair shine and scalp smoothness. These give the shampoo moisturizing conditioner properties and helps with dandruff. Botanical Keratin: Naturally derived botanical keratin plays an important role in restoring healthy hair. Frizzy and damaged hair may stem from a lack of keratin, which this ingredient generously replenishes. The Holistic Promise: By utilizing only the purest organic ingredients for oil treatment, the shedding of dead skin cells is reduced and leaves a fresh shine. This shampoo offers a deliciously spicy aroma, and is guaranteed to turn shower time into a remedial and therapeutic experience.",

After bending gently, keep your head forward and brush from neck to end of hair (behind the ears), releasing oil to the brush to go through the rest of your hair. Do your entire head, then stand up and put your hair back to normal by brushing from hairline to tip (the hair above your ears). This improves the hair with the oils after repeat 3 times every day. Because the glands in our body to release oils are in the back of the head, the top of the head is not great for releasing oils.However, the boar bristles hair brush can spread the oil from the top to all of your hair.",

        "features": "AUTHENTIC KITSCH PRODUCT SOLD BY KITSCH, LLC ONLY - any other seller is selling counterfeit product. THE BEST HAIR TIE FOR YOUR HAIR: Transparent 8 pack is perfect for any hair color! Kitsch hair coils are gentle on your hair. The smooth plastic, spiralized construction helps to prevent tangling and consequently prevents hair breakage when you remove them.;HELP PREVENT PONYTAIL BUMPS & HAIR HEADACHES: The spiral design of telephone cord hair ties spreads the \"pressure\" of the hair elastic out over a greater surface area of your hair, which helps to minimize the dreaded ponytail bump that hair ties can create on styled hair. Hair headaches from too-tight ponytails are also a thing of the past! Traditional hair ties function by concentrating the tension in a single area of your hair, prevent damage and strand breakage by spreading out the tension;CUTE IN YOUR HAIR, AND ON YOUR WRIST: Kitsch Hair Coils are an everyday essential and come in a variety of beautiful colors. Whether you are looking to match your hair color, or add a fun pop of color to your top knot, Kitsch has the coils for you. Perfect for blondes, brunettes, redheads and any color in between. Kitsch coils also look great on your wrist. The coils stretch to comfortably wear as a bracelet when not in use, so they are ready for ponytail or messy bun duty at any time.;WATERPROOF AND HYGIENIC: Phone cord hair ties are non-absorbent, so they can be worn while swimming or bathing without that \"nasty wet hair tie\" feeling, and they can be removed from wet hair much more easily than a traditional ponytail holder. Also, because they do not absorb fluids, Kitsch hair coils are more hygienic than fabric wrapped rubberbands.;SMALL BUT MIGHTY!: Kitsch hair coils are 1.5 inches in diameter, but don't be deceived by their size! Kitsch coils stretch easily and generously to hold up all of your hair in a ponytail, messy bun, or braid, and comfortably stretch to be worn on your wrist when not in use. If your coil happens to stretch larger than its original size, simply place it in a cup of warm water or use a hot blow dryer to shrink it to its original size.",

But the unique cone shaped plastic bristles work to separate the hair sideways instead of down, gently unraveling even the toughest tangles.;CHILD FRIENDLY - No more fits when it's time to get ready to go out! The Glide Thru brush doesn't dig into the scalp or rip out hair like other brushes. It takes out tangles without yanking or hurting. One customer review states, \"My daughter used to cry every time Mommy brushed her hair. This brush is the best thing I ever bought for her.\";LIFE CHANGING BRUSH - Other brushes have beads at the end that can dig into the scalp and cause pain and get caught in tangles. The Glide Thru brush has painless soft plastic bristles that massage the scalp and increase circulation, which may help increase hair growth. One customer writes: \"I brushed my hair for at least 2 or 3 minutes because it felt so good.\" It also smoothes the cuticle layer, making your hair shine!;SATISFACTION GUARANTEED - Everyone's experience with a hairbush is different. If you aren't completely satisfied, contact us to return your brush, no questions asked!",

Hair is restored to luster and shine. If it could smile, it would.<br /> <br />Our spray-on, leave-in Thermal Shield protects hair against everything we do to abuse it.

Â¬Itâs a natural detangler for unwieldy and thick hair. And perfect for use before outdoor activities.<br /> <br />Rosemary extract helps stimulate hair follicles, making hair grow longer and stronger. Current research shows it also helps slow down hair loss. Peach extractâs multiple benefits for hair include acting an emollient to enable hair to retain natural color as well as chemically applied color. It also helps protect hair from sun, wind, rain and pollution. It deters frizz and helps prevent breakage and tangles. Thyme extract stimulates the scalp, helping keep both it and hair healthy. Sage extract keeps hair shiny, more manageable and improves texture. And ginseng extract improves hairâs regeneration ability, along with the health of hair follicles and cells, preventing hair loss.<br /> <br />The Thermal Shield stops hair from becoming brittle, cracked, and dry and helps to restore split ends.

Itâs also one of those products that you may want to buy in multiples so you can store one in your car, your gym bag, your desk and your purse. Created to help replace the natural oils lost during heat styling and blow drying, it conditions and moisturizes hair for up to 24 hours. A pea-sized amount is enough to transform puffy, parched hair into ultra-glossy locks and smooth frizz. Camouflage split ends, fight static in the winter time, and even use as a heat protectant by applying to damp hair prior to blow drying. Suitable for all hair types and safe for colour- and chemically-treated hair, this is one weapon youâll want to make sure you always have in your armory. </p> <p><b><u>How to Use John Frieda Frizz Ease Secret Weapon Touch-Up Creme:</b></u></p> <p>Start with a small amount of product and add more if necessary. Rub a small amount of John Frieda Frizz Ease Secret Weapon Touch-Up Creme between palms and âpullâ through dry hair, concentrating on ends where hair looks driest, then smooth hands lightly over the surface. Use more product to tame trouble spots of frizz, flyaways, or static. Reapply as needed.</p> <p><b><u>About John Frieda</b></u></p> <p>Over three decades ago, the John Frieda brand started with the opening of a salon on New Cavendish Street, London. Today, the vision of the brand reflects that salon heritage: delivering products that target specific style problems and transform them. For salon-caliber results you can see and feel.</p> <p>We learned that to get there, the solution has to be tailored to your hairâs specific needs. So we made it our mission to crack the differences behind exactly what makes blondes brighter, brunettes shine, and frizz an ancient memory. Our products are fueled by an understanding of what makes each individual hair type unique. To help your style meet its perfect match.</p>",

        "productDescription": "At Nexxus, we understand that the hair structure consists of up to 90% protein, so we believe helping hair return to its optimal state means treating it with protein at high levels. Nexxus scientists set out to find inspiration from precious ingredients that could help seal severely damaged hair using a leading edge approach to protein research called Proteomics. The Nexxus Keraphix Healing System for Severely Damaged Hair, with Keratin Protein and Black Rice, heals visible signs of severe hair damage. Rice has long been a storied secret of strong heathy hair for women of the Huangluo village in China, where fermented rice water has unlocked the key to growing long, luxurious hair. Women of the village go to great lengths to preserve their hair by washing it in fermented rice water and often undergo just one haircut their entire lifetime. Extensive testing showed that Glutamic Acid is a key amino acid lost in hair when it is exposed to severe damage. After finding that Black Rice was among the richest sources of Glutamic Acid in nature, Nexxus combined this ingredient with Keratin Protein and other essential nutrients to create a new hair healing ritual for clinically proven healthy-looking hair with just one use. Salon-crafted with our exclusive PROTEINFUSION blend with Keratin Protein and Black Rice, Keraphix Conditioner acts as the second step of the treatment process, healing signs of damage while bringing strength with weightless effect. Step 1: Apply Keraphix Shampoo for Severely Damaged Hair to wet hair and experience the rich foamy lather. Rinse thoroughly. Step 2: Follow with Keraphix Conditioner for Severely Damaged Hair or Keraphix Masque for Severely Damaged Hair to help heal signs of damage. Step 3: Once a week, follow with the Keraphix Reconstructing Treatment for a complete hair treatment for healthy-looking, soft and smooth hair.",

Art Naturalsâ Detangling Hair Brush Setâs two ergonomically designed brushes make that pain a thing of the pastâwhile they minimize breakage and add shine. The clever little brushes fit in your palm so you can be stylinâ easily, anytime. Oh, and theyâre great for kidsâ hair, too!<br /> <br />ArtNaturalsâ Detangling Hair Brush Kit is the premium solution to detangling knotted and matted hair. ArtNaturals is excited to offer this innovative solution to the often painful and (as parents can attest) stressful task of removing tangles, knots, and curls from unruly hair of all types. With these thoughtfully designed brushes, youâll no longer need bulky and awkward ones that dig into your (or your childâs) hair and scalp. Our Premier Detangling Brushes use innovative design and ergonomic motion to provide a pain-free brushing experience.<br /> <br />Almost everyoneâs hair tangles to some degree, but those with super-thick and curly, long and fine, or dry and damaged hair experience even more tangles. And, if you donât have time to brush your hair during the day, you can expect more tangles as well.<br /> <br />The unique curved handle and bristles are ergonomically designed to work easily with your natural brushing motion. Soft, gentle cone-shaped bristles massage the scalp while they effortlessly separate hair in a unique sideways motion. This process means no more tugging or pulling hair. The separating motion results in silky, smooth, tangle-free hairâand an incredibly clean brush. No tufts or clumps of hair to dig out.<br /> <br />Perfect for men, women, and kids, the brushes are ideal for all hair typesâthick, thin, curly or straight. Guaranteed âowieâ free!\"",

        "productDescription": "At Nexxus, we understand that the hair structure consists of up to 90% protein, so we believe helping hair return to its optimal state means treating it with protein at high levels. Nexxus scientists set out to find inspiration from precious ingredients that could help seal severely damaged hair using a leading edge approach to protein research called Proteomics. The Nexxus Keraphix Healing System for Severely Damaged Hair, with Keratin Protein and Black Rice, heals visible signs of severe hair damage. Rice has long been a storied secret of strong heathy hair for women of the Huangluo village in China, where fermented rice water has unlocked the key to growing long, luxurious hair. Women of the village go to great lengths to preserve their hair by washing it in fermented rice water and often undergo just one haircut their entire lifetime. Extensive testing showed that Glutamic Acid is a key amino acid lost in hair when it is exposed to severe damage. After finding that Black Rice was among the richest sources of Glutamic Acid in nature, Nexxus combined this ingredient with Keratin Protein and other essential nutrients to create a new hair healing ritual for clinically proven healthy-looking hair with just one use. Salon-crafted with our exclusive PROTEINFUSION blend with Keratin Protein and Black Rice, Keraphix Shampoo acts as the first step of the treatment process, gently cleansing your severely damaged hair, priming it for continued treatment. Nexxus New York Salon recommends: Step 1: Apply Keraphix Shampoo for Severely Damaged Hair to wet hair and experience the rich foamy lather. Rinse thoroughly. Step 2: Follow with Keraphix Conditioner for Severely Damaged Hair or Keraphix Masque for Severely Damaged Hair to help heal signs of damage. Step 3: Once a week, follow with the Keraphix Reconstructing Treatment for a complete hair treatment for healthy-looking, soft and smooth hair.",

        "productDescription": "Our black castor oil is made using traditional Jamaican methods that have been passed down for years. Hand-processed castor beans are roasted and boiled, and the oil is skimmed off until no water remains. The result is a light to dark brown, nutty-scented oil that is ideal for many uses. It is great for hair, as it is a moisturizing oil with natural reflective qualities that boosts shine. It can be used on eyelashes to encourage growth, as well as nails to encourage growth and protect from bacteria. Black castor oil can also be used to moisturize the skin and reduce the appearance of scars, stretch marks, and acne. Skin conditions such as eczema can be soothed with castor oil, as it creates a protective barrier on the skin to lock in moisture. Our black castor oil contains no additives, and is ideal for every skin type.<br><br>How To Use<br><br>Apply as desired to skin or hair. Can be brushed through hair as a detangler, used as a deep conditioner or hot oil treatment, or rubbed on skin for restorative moisture. Brush through eyelashes for improved growth and shine, or use on hands to soften cuticles and prevent fungal issues.<br><br>About Us <br><br>Tropic Isle Living was launched in 1992 with the conviction to bring to market a range of Jamaican herbs and herbal products that have been valued for generations for their benefits to the hair, skin and body. For over 20 years, they have specialized in making products with ingredients from Jamaica, Africa, and the Caribbean. Our products are not mass produced; they are made the traditional, hand-processed way. It is one way to preserve the natural magnetism of the products while paying homage to its legacy.",

It's no wonder people are calling BluMaan original the best men's hair product of all time. How is this better than the other products? This product took months of work to create exactly what the online style community asked for. Original by BluMaan is as close to the consensus of an ideal product as we could possibly make it. I mean for real. It took 5 different teams of chemists to come up with a product we're proud to present. How long does it hold? Holds for between 10 hours to up-to 2 days. In our tests original held for between 10 hours and 2 days, depending on the hair type. We have tested the product on a dozen knowledgeable community members and the results were that the product held for significantly longer than other popular products. That being said, keep in mind that there are tons of hair types so hold might vary depending. Some may give more or less hold than the people tested so far. Directions: this product is specially designed to be used before and after you blow dry your hair. It can also be used as pre or post-style if desired. Step 1: if using as a pre-style, apply to damp hair. The product has a built in heat protectant. Thoroughly rub the desired amount of styling Meraki in hands until evenly distributed. Step 2: apply an even coating to hair. Step 3: blow dry to desired style. Step 4: apply a finishing layer of styling Meraki. Generally, less product is required for dry hair compared to damp.

With the minimal shine from this Fiber, you'll get a nearly matte finish so you don't have to worry about your intentionally messy look actually looking intentional.;Adds Thickness & Texture - Smooth Viking's Fiber is designed to thicken and texturize hair while offering the hold needed for styling. This means it works great on naturally thick hair, but that it will also give you the results you want in naturally thin or thinning hair too.;Also for Shorter Hairstyles - Short hair deserves attention too, which is why Smooth Viking has made this Fiber specifically with shorter hairstyles in mind. Since shorter hair can sometimes have a mind of its own and be difficult to style, this product binds to the strands and brings them together to offer a cohesive appearance and make styling as easy as can be.;Works Like Gels & Creams - Smooth Viking's American made Fiber Cream works a lot like gels and creams, but its fibrous texture makes it easier to get the look you want without worrying about overusing or giving yourself a shiny head of hair when all you wanted was a subtle style. It can be used on dry or even slightly damp hair to achieve whatever style you decide to go with.",

Silky Touch fixes it in seconds! If you have never used dry shampoo powder before it can take several time experimenting with the product to learn how to use it correctly. Very small amount of the product needed to achieve the goal. Fine, thin hair will need less of the product while thicker hair may need more. Hair that just started to get oily will need less of the product, but if you wait longer you will need a little more.<p>\"The bottle may seem small, but I need such a small amount that I can't even predict how long this will last for me. (I ordered my first bottle many months ago and it's hardly made a dent...I assume I'll get 6+ months out of this. It's already lasted longer than some spray formulas.)\"<p> One of ingredients is Silica. It is a mineral, and a major component of sand, rocks, bentonite and other clay.
